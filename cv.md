### Summary

I'm a front end developer and an individual entrepreneur. My experience in web development is more than 7+ years 
with a break of 4 years for other professions. Therefore, I still remember what cross-browser development 
for Internet Explorer 6 is and what table-based layout is. Those were terrible times for web developers... =)

But times change and web technologies are constantly improving. You have to keep an eye on them. 
Now I want to improve my JavaScript and React skills, learn Typescript and possibly Angular as well. 
I really enjoy studying and learning new things. I have a great desire to grow professionally. 
My main goal is to learn how to create good web applications and learn the technologies necessary for this.

I am a calm, responsible and executive, attentive to details person (I always use Pixel Perfect =)) 
who has an analytical mindset and a good learning ability.
